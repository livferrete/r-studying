This dataset was created to explore the Academy Awards given to the main movie categories in this century (from 2001 to 2023, date of creation), 
with the purpose of exploring data analysis techniques and teaching machine learning concepts. It was developed during the "Bioestat√≠stica" course, 
attended by the 2024-1 Biomedicine bachelor students at UNIRIO.

We hope its accessibility and diverse contextual information make it an exquisite - and also cool - choice for educational purposes within the data 
science community.
